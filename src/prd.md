# RentGPU - GPU Rental Marketplace PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: RentGPU democratizes access to high-performance GPU computing by connecting those who need computational power with those who have idle hardware, creating a cost-effective distributed computing ecosystem.
- **Success Indicators**: High user adoption rates, positive cost savings for renters, meaningful passive income for providers, platform reliability metrics (99%+ uptime), and strong user satisfaction scores.
- **Experience Qualities**: Professional, trustworthy, efficient - users should feel confident in both the technical capabilities and financial security of the platform.

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Complex Application - advanced functionality with user accounts, payments, real-time monitoring, and marketplace features
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting and Interacting - users actively rent GPUs, list hardware, monitor usage, and manage earnings in a dynamic marketplace environment

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Traditional cloud GPU services are expensive and inflexible, while personal GPU owners have idle hardware generating no revenue - we bridge this gap with peer-to-peer rentals
- **User Context**: ML engineers, researchers, and developers need affordable GPU access for training and inference, while gamers and crypto miners want to monetize idle time
- **Critical Path**: Trust building → easy onboarding → efficient matching → secure transactions → ongoing management
- **Key Moments**: First rental transaction, first earnings payout, and platform reliability during critical workloads

## Essential Features
- **GPU Marketplace**: Browse available hardware with detailed specs, pricing, and availability - validates through successful rental completions
- **Secure Payment System**: Wallet-based transactions with escrow protection - measured by payment success rates and dispute resolution
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Usage tracking, performance metrics, and billing transparency - verified through accurate billing and user satisfaction
- **Provider Tools**: Hardware listing, pricing controls, and earnings tracking - success measured by provider retention and income generation

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, innovation, and reliability - users should feel they're using cutting-edge technology backed by enterprise-grade security
- **Design Personality**: Clean, professional, and slightly futuristic - balancing approachability with technical sophistication
- **Visual Metaphors**: Computing networks, energy flow, and interconnected systems reflecting the distributed nature of the platform
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with progressive disclosure - core actions are immediately visible while advanced features are easily accessible

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Triadic with complementary accents - balanced approach supporting multiple user types and actions
- **Primary Color**: Deep teal (oklch(0.45 0.15 200)) - represents trust, technology, and stability
- **Secondary Colors**: Rich purple (oklch(0.65 0.12 280)) for differentiation and sophisticated contrast
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant teal (oklch(0.5 0.18 180)) - draws attention to key actions and success states
- **Color Psychology**: Teal conveys reliability and innovation, purple suggests premium quality, while maintaining professional credibility
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 minimum)
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (light gray): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0.02 240)) - 15.8:1 contrast ratio
  - Card (white): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0.02 240)) - 16.2:1 contrast ratio
  - Primary (deep teal): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - 9.1:1 contrast ratio
  - Secondary (purple): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - 5.8:1 contrast ratio
  - Accent (teal): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - 8.3:1 contrast ratio

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy - ensures consistency while maintaining clear information architecture
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headlines (700), medium subheadings (600), regular body (400) with mathematical scale relationships
- **Font Personality**: Inter represents modern professionalism, excellent readability, and technical precision
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing (1.5x), optimal line lengths (45-75 characters), and sufficient contrast ratios
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent spacing, alignment, and sizing throughout the interface
- **Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts for complete typography system
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is specifically designed for high legibility across all screen sizes and resolutions

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Hero section draws focus to value proposition, then guides through benefits, pricing, and social proof
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing creates breathing room and emphasizes content importance without feeling sparse
- **Grid System**: 12-column responsive grid with consistent gutters ensuring perfect alignment across all screen sizes
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement for larger screens
- **Content Density**: Balanced information architecture - enough detail for informed decisions without overwhelming users

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle hover effects and transitions reinforce interactivity while maintaining professional feel
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary actions get gentle glow effects, card hovers provide immediate feedback, transitions maintain spatial relationships
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, purposeful animations that enhance usability without drawing unnecessary attention

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for GPU listings and features, buttons for clear actions, badges for status indicators, forms for onboarding
- **Component Customization**: Rounded corners (0.75rem radius), subtle shadows, and color-coded elements for different user types
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, and focus states with smooth transitions
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor Icons for technical accuracy and visual consistency - CPU, wallet, magnifying glass, trend indicators
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary buttons for main actions, outline buttons for secondary actions, ghost buttons for subtle interactions
- **Spacing System**: 4px base unit with 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-friendly 44px minimum target sizes, stacked layouts, simplified navigation

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent patterns for buttons, cards, inputs, and layout structures
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color palette, typography scale, spacing system, component variations, and interaction patterns
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing, alignment, and proportions create predictable, professional appearance
- **Brand Alignment**: Technology-forward aesthetic reinforces platform innovation and reliability

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance achieved with all text combinations exceeding 4.5:1 ratio, many exceeding 7:1 for enhanced readability

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Trust concerns with peer-to-peer transactions, technical complexity for non-technical users, hardware compatibility issues
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear error messages, comprehensive FAQ section, responsive customer support, and progressive disclosure of technical details
- **Technical Constraints**: Real-time availability updates, secure payment processing, reliable hardware monitoring, and global network latency

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Component-based architecture allows easy expansion of GPU categories, user types, and platform features
- **Testing Focus**: Payment flows, hardware compatibility verification, user onboarding completion rates, and cross-device functionality
- **Critical Questions**: How quickly can users complete their first rental? How effectively does the design build trust? How well does the interface scale across technical skill levels?

## Reflection
This approach uniquely combines marketplace efficiency with enterprise security, making high-performance computing accessible while maintaining the professionalism required for business-critical workloads. The design balances technical sophistication with user-friendly interfaces, ensuring both novice and expert users can navigate effectively. The light theme approach enhances readability and provides a modern, clean aesthetic that builds trust and conveys reliability.
